## Attendance Calci
An attendance calculator that integrates with the PESU Academy website.

Attendance calci adds an extra column to the Attendance page on PESU academy which you can use to calculate what you want.

## What can it do?
There are three things you can calculate with this:
* Attendance after bunking some number of classes
* How many classes one needs to attended to reach some percentage of attendance
* How many classes one can bunk while retaining some percentage of attendance

## Installation Instructions
### Chrome users
* Download the extension from the [releases page](https://github.com/GlowingScrewdriver/attendance_calci/releases) (you should download the file with the .crx extension).
* Go to the extensions page (about:extensions or chrome://extensions) and enable Developer Mode (the switch near the top-right of the page).
* Drag and drop the downloaded .crx file onto the extensions page. The extension should now get installed.
Note: while downloading the file, you might get a notice indicating that the extension couldn't be installed (CRX\_REQUIRED\_PROOF\_MISSING or some such). Ignore this error.

### Firefox users
* Download the extension from the [releases page](https://github.com/GlowingScrewdriver/attendance_calci/releases) (you should download the file with the .xpi extension).
* The extension should get installed automatically.

After installing the extension, simply log on to PESU Academy and go to "My Attendance". You should see an extra column on the attendance table. 
Note: If the page takes too load, the extension might not work. If you notice that nothing happens when you load the attendance page, simply reload the page and see if it works.
